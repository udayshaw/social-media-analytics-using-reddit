>Does anyone know if this is the different world or world one?

I do not believe it is a World One.

To my current understanding, the World One only comes in a standard generic Black on Black spec.

I cant say with 100% certainty because the World One used to be a B2B dealer exclusive, and I wouldn't be too surprised if they had more options available than us mere B2C retailers.

&#x200B;

>I can't seem to find the exact configuration

Hard to decipher off of just one picture and no product codes...but just off first glance it appears to be some combination of the following options...

**Back Mesh :** Monofil Stripe - Amber  /  Pinstripe - Cadmium  /  Silver Check - Topaz

**Seat Fabric :** Lotus - Ochre  /  Ginkgo - Wheat

If I had to pick one, my guess would be a Mono Stripe Amber + Lotus Ochre.

As for the other specs, I'd need more information.

&#x200B;

>Worth it?

I think $100 is a pretty sweat deal for any Humanscale chair.

If you're buying for yourself, you can't really go wrong. Would beat out anything else for $100 that isn't an extreme unicorn bargain. Even if you don't like it, I would imagine with some TLC you could sell it for at least that much if not more to someone else.

If you're buying just to clean and flip to someone else, I'd consider that the demand for Humanscale products is not at the same level as their better known competitors. It could be an easy flip...but I wouldn't expect a quick flip. Hope this help!

I *highly* recommend watching [this 5-minute video](https://youtu.be/TOd_e5iZ9tM) on ideal upright seated posture, in which posture and ergonomics expert Olivier Girard demonstrates the healthiest way to sit upright with and without back support.\n\nThe [Colamy Kirin](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4Y2CNR1) would be good for helping you maintain ideal upright posture due to its backrest's pronounced lower lumbar curve. I recommend the second-to-most upright tilt-locked position, as the most upright may actually cause you to lean forward. The Kirin is able to recline deep, but the pronounced lumbar curve makes it rather uncomfortable for lounging. *Disclaimer*: I only tested the Kirin for ~5 minutes, but I found the seat foam quality questionable, i.e. it feels like it might go flat in a year or two (granted I weigh 220 lbs).\n\nIf you want a chair that provides more of a balance between comfort and posture support, I recommend the [Union & Scale Essentials 5-80M](https://www.staples.com/union-scale-essentials-5-80m-ergonomic-fabric-mesh-swivel-task-chair-black-un60991/product_24525434). Its seat foam is more comfy and plush (and surprisingly high-quality for the price) and the lumbar support is less pronounced than the Kirin's. This makes the 5-80M significantly better than the Kirin for occasional reclined lounging. Due to its weaker lumbar support, the 5-80M can facilitate *decent* upright seated posture on its own, but *perfect* posture would always require a little effort on your part even while using the backrest. Also, research shows that thick-cushioned seats constrain movement and blood flow more than thinner seats, particularly when used for hours at a time. *Disclaimer*: Like the Kirin, I only tested the 5-80M for ~5 minutes. I am convinced the seat foam is high-quality and will never go flat. I found the seat immediately comfortable at 220 lbs, but my ~140-lb colleague found the seat too firm; however, I am sure the seat would break in and become comfortable for her with a few weeks or months of regular use.\n\nBoth the Kirin and 5-80M have adjustable armrests that could fit under your desk. Unfortunately, the 5-80M's armrests are positioned too far forward by design, so they can not be set level with your desk surface (not that this is necessary, just a nice-to-have) without forcing you to reach forward to type/mouse.

Even when buying secondhand/as-is/without warranty, one should consider Brand Reputation...

A product with a warrantable life of 12 years should be expected to perform and last much longer than a comparable product with a warrantable life of 1 year.

If a manufacturer stands behind their product essentially saying ""if anything goes wrong between now and 2036, come back to us and we got you covered"". They are confident and essentially betting that the build quality and design of their product should last much longer than 12 years. And they often do, which is why there are so many 20+ year old Steelcase/Herman Miller chairs still in circulation.

On the flipside, if a manufacturer says ""if anything goes wrong within the first year, we'll take care of you""....It is a nice gesture and better than nothing at all, but this is mainly offered just to cover one-off product defects. These manufacturers are well aware that their products are not up to the same standard and wont be as likely to last as long.

&#x200B;

Another little piece of food for thought,

So there's Consumer/End-User prices, Retailer/Dealer prices, and then Manufacturer costs, right?

Manufacturer makes their money by selling to their Retailers/Dealers.

* Retailer/Dealer Price minus Manufacturers Cost.

Retailers/Dealers make their money by selling to consumers.

* Consumer Price minus Retailer/Dealer Price.

I mention this because Brands like Steelcase & Herman Miller...sure, you're paying a partial premium for the brand name...but I would consider the fact that these Brand's products entry Manufacturer Costs are 2-4x MORE $$ than most of the cheap alternatives end Consumer price.

That in itself should be a clear tell that the value/durability/quality/etc. will be significantly better. It just simply has to be.

Hypothetically speaking,

A New chair being sold to a consumer for $200 was probably built for <$50.

A New chair being sold to a consumer for $1300 was probably built for \~$400.

Incredibly unlikely for a chair that costs a manufacturer $400 to build will be of lesser quality relative to a $200 retail product.

&#x200B;

**TLDR;** Yes. A used/refurb $1300+ chair for $300 will almost certainly be better than any $300 New chair in terms of build quality and longevity. Hope this helps.

Have you tried the Haworth? And you said you tried the Alterseat briefly does that mean you are using Herman Miller or something?  


Generally do you think the Alterseat is a safe option?  


I would try to message the that Carousell seller about that Haworth since in the description they mentioned you can go test them!  


Thanks for finding that one! I Don't know how I didn't find them before. Thanks !",kf86a03,,,,

There are a lot of manufacturing costs that are easy to overlook.

If a chair uses higher quality parts, that adds to material costs.

If a chair uses parts that are not mass produced, that adds to material costs.

If a chair is hand assembled vs not assembled or machine assembled, that adds to non-material manufacturing costs.

If a chair is individually QC’d by a human, that adds to non-material manufacturing costs.

If a chair has a long fully inclusive / comprehensive warranty, that will drive an increase in the chair price to offset the average long term servicing costs.

If a chair has high R&D costs, it drives an increase in the cost of the chair to offset those R&D costs over time.
Think R&D costs for something like the Herman Miller Embody back/seat design


Material costs are a big piece of the cost, but the chair cost needs to reflect other manufacturing costs as well.

There are a lot of manufacturing costs that are easy to overlook.

If a chair uses higher quality parts, that adds to material costs.

If a chair uses parts that are not mass produced, that adds to material costs.

If a chair is hand assembled vs not assembled or machine assembled, that adds to non-material manufacturing costs.

If a chair is individually QC’d by a human, that adds to non-material manufacturing costs.

If a chair has a long fully inclusive / comprehensive warranty, that will drive an increase in the chair price to offset the average long term servicing costs.

If a chair has high R&D costs, it drives an increase in the cost of the chair to offset those R&D costs over time.

I gravitate a bit more towards the more classic colorways offered in Corde 4, but if I were looking for something a little more unique that will stand out and make more of a statement, then maybe Fourtis.

Sorry I kind of danced around your question, but hope this makes sense and still helps.

Both Corde4 and Fourtis fabrics are nearly identical in terms of their quality and material composition.

I believe the only real difference between the two is the way the threads are weaved, with Corde 4 being more of a solid color where as Fourtis offers a bit of a contrast.

If you haven't seen these already, here's a simple way to compare the two lines in detail.

The Liberty and Diffrient Smart certainly have more in common with each other than not.

major differences, not really.

The only feature that comes to mind is I believe only the Liberty allows the optional Gel seat option as opposed to the standard foam...but I think that's it?

*The rest of this is me just shooting from the hip,*

I believe the standard baseline ""Quickship"" versions of each model are near identical in terms of comfort & function aside from looks.

They were both designed by Niels Diffrient, if my memory serves me right I believe the Liberty came out a few years prior to the Smart.

I can't speak for Humanscale...but to my understanding the Smart was introduced as a more versatile next-gen model that's goal was just to improve on what they already had with the Liberty.

They rolled out the Smart, Smart Plus, Smart Ocean, Smart Conference, Smart Occasional chairs...but there was only one Liberty chair.
